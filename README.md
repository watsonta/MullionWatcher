# MullionWatcher
An app to mitigate condensation on aluminum window mullions

Utilizing WeatherHawk myBlueT temperature sensors, Twitter and a smart thermostat, MullionWatcher enables
you to manage interior climate to avoid condensation on aluminum window mullions.

Written in Java, MullionWatcher is extensible and can run on small Linux machines (e.g. RaspberryPi). When
used in conjunction with USB Bluetooth 4.0 and WiFi adapters, it is completely wireless and can be placed
anywhere in the home.
